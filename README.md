# converging-to-e

I decided to write an elementary proof of the fact that the sequence $n \mathbin{/} \sqrt[n]{n!}$ is increasing and converges to $e$ after watching that [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fI0S-HeYrQ) from Michael Penn (see also [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVf0T0TUsJw) from the same author on the same topic).
